# Weight Tracking App
&nbsp;

### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This weight tracking app was developed to meet the needs of users seeking a simple, effective way to log their daily weight and track progress towared fitness goals. The app allows users to log in, record their weight, view their weight history and retrieve notifications when they approach or achieve their goals.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UIdesigns keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The key screens included a login/registration screen, a weight entry screen, a progress visualiation screen (dashboard), a screen for updating weight entries and goals, and a screen for SMS notification settings. These features were designed with users in mind by prioritizing ease of navigations with a simple and clean modern design. By using a lean layout and easy navigation, users can effortlessly move through the app without feeling overwhelmed. Icons and buttons are labeled clearly to reduce any confusion when using th app. There was a consistant theme, color scheme, and font that helps users become familiar with the the apps interface quickly. The designs were successful because they are aligned with user needs and preferences and stuck to a primary goal. That goal is to provides users with a simple, effective tool for weight tracking.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I began by designing the layout of the app, focusing on creating a clean and intuitive interface by making sure the UI aligned with the user's expected flow thourhg the app. After finishing the layout, I begain coding the functions, following the sequience of how a user would interact with thapp. This user-first apporach helped me to maintain a logical progression that help to make sure that each feature work well with the rest of the app. I used a user-centric development flow by coding the app in the order of how a typical user would navigate it, wheter being a new or current user. I also used an iterative apporoach by working on each feature one at a time, refining it before moving on to the next, to make sure the app functioned as intended at every step. These techniques and strategies can be applied to any future projects because they ensure an organized and user-focused development process. Starting with the layout ensures a clear structure for the app, making it easier to build features that match the user's flow. Codign the same order that the user interact with the app, helps keep the focus on their experience, making sure thte app is easy to use and meets their needs. Sepating the design from the functionality makes the project easeir to manage, update, and expand as needed. By following these approaches, future apps can be developed more efficiently and with better results.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
To make sure that the app was functional, I manually tested each feature as I develped it. This included entering sample data, navigating bewteen screens, and simulating user actions to confirm the app behaved as expected. I also check for any crashes, layout misalignments, and incorrect data handling. Testing is important because it helps to identify and fix issues before users encounter them. This process reveals issues scuh as misalined UI elements and incorrect handling of empty weight entries, which I was able to fix. It also made sure that features worked well together. 

&nbsp;

### Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One of the challenges during development was ensuring that weight entries were display in an orderly and progressive manner by date. After I completed the code and tested it, I noticed that when users update an entrt, it would remain in the same position in the grid, making the entries appear out of order. This could cause confusion for users. To address this, I adjusted the grid logic to automatically sort the entries by date when a ne wentry was added or an existing one was updated. This ensured that all entries remained in the correct chronological order, regardless of when they were modified. This involved linking the date field to a soring funtion that triggered whenever the data was refreshed, ensuring the display was always accurate.

### In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Working on and completing this app allowed me to grow in knowledge, skills, and experience. Once specific component where I was particualry successful was the entry sorting and display feature. This feature required not only effective UI handling but also strong database entry and managements skills. When sueres updated their weight entries, the updates would remain in the same position on the grid. To address this, I implemented a sorting mechanism that reorganized entries by date whenever chages were made. This ensured that data was stored and displayed in a way that was both logical and user-friendly. It demonstrated my abililty to manage database operations, optimize data flow, and enhance user experience.
