# Weight Tracking App

## Overview
The **Weight Tracking App** is a mobile application developed in **Java/XML** with a **Material Design UI**. It provides users with a simple, effective tool to log daily weight and track progress toward fitness goals. The app allows users to create an account, record weight entries, view progress trends, update goals, and receive notifications when approaching or achieving milestones.

---

## User Needs & Goals
The app addresses the needs of users who want an easy-to-use fitness tracking tool by:
- Allowing **daily weight logging** and historical record keeping.
- Providing **visual progress tracking** to monitor weight changes over time.
- Supporting **goal setting** with **notifications** for approaching or achieving goals.

---

## Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration.
- **Weight Entry:** Add, edit, and manage daily weight logs.
- **Progress Visualization:** Dashboard with charts to display progress trends.
- **Goal Tracking:** Set, update, and track weight goals.
- **Notifications:** SMS alerts when nearing or reaching a set goal.
- **Settings Management:** Configure notifications and update goal settings.

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Design
- **Minimalist Design:** Clean layout for quick and easy navigation.
- **Consistency:** Unified color scheme, fonts, and icon styles.
- **Clarity:** Clearly labeled buttons and icons to reduce confusion.
- **Logical Flow:** Navigation designed to follow a typical user journey.

---

## Development Process
1. **Planning & Layout:** Designed UI components and navigation flow before coding.
2. **User-Centric Coding:** Developed features in the sequence a user would interact with them.
3. **Iterative Approach:** Built, tested, and refined one feature at a time for stability.

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Manual Testing:** Simulated user interactions, entered sample data, and navigated between screens.
- **Issue Resolution:** Fixed layout misalignments, data handling errors, and crashes.
- **UI Verification:** Ensured visual consistency across all screens.

---

## Challenges & Solutions
**Challenge:** Updated weight entries were not displaying in chronological order.  
**Solution:** Implemented a **date-linked sorting function** in the database logic to reorder entries upon any data update or refresh. This ensured a clear and logical progression of weight history.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Java & Android Development** â€” Built a complete mobile app using Java/XML.
- **Database Management** â€” Created and managed persistent weight entry storage with sorting.
- **UI/UX Principles** â€” Designed an intuitive interface based on user-centered design.
- **Problem-Solving** â€” Implemented logic to ensure data accuracy and clarity.
- **Iterative Development** â€” Incremental feature building with continuous testing.
